# Video
Soon in my account in twitter and linkedin .todo

# How to use it?
After setup, Open IP address of server and enjoy it.
todo

# What are the requirements?
- Arduino Uno
- Old laptop
- OS in old laptop is distribution from GUN Linux, If specs of laptop is low can use Bodhi Linux like the project  
- arduino-mk, Apache server, PHP, and Python3. Soon I will be make shell script for setup to do that.

# Introduction:
I have an Arduino Uno and I want it to be online or at least send a code to it while it is not connected to my device. I remembered an old laptop in our house from 2009, so I installed a light Linux distribution for it, and my goal was to implement a project that I could connect an Arduino to and control it from another device.
This is an opportunity to develop my various skills and I learned many things during its implementation from solving problems in Linux powers or communicating more than one language with each other. In this project I share with you the journey of it in detail!


# Implementation:
