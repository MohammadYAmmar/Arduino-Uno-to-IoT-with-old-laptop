# Introduction:
I have an Arduino Uno and I want it to be online or at least send a code to it while it is not connected to my device. I remembered an old laptop in our house from 2009, so I installed a light Linux distribution for it, and my goal was to implement a project that I could connect an Arduino to and control it from another device.
This is an opportunity to develop my various skills and I learned many things during its implementation from solving problems in Linux powers or communicating more than one language with each other. In this project I share with you the journey of it in detail!

If you have seen the description and tool with codes, can you recommend my Arduino [todo] or Shell scripting programming skills on LinkedIn? :)

Do not forget to give the project a star ‚≠êüåü to encourage us to continue if you liked it.
